Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

TensorFlow is better suited for production environments and large-scale deployments, 
while PyTorch is preferred for research, education, and rapid experimentation.

I would choose TensorFlow for industry applications, and PyTorch for academic research and prototyping.

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Jupyter Notebooks allow for interactive data visualization and analysis, making it easier to understand patterns
and relationships in the data.
2.Model prototyping and experimentation: They are ideal for testing different models, hyperparameters, and algorithms in a flexible, interactive environment.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

spaCy provides pre-trained NLP pipelines for tasks like tokenization, named entity recognition which are not available in basic string operations.
It offers high performance and accuracy for NLP tasks, while basic Python string operations are limited and require manual coding for complex NLP tasks.




COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

Target Applications
Scikit-learn is focused on classical machine learning tasks such as classification and clustering 
It is ideal for problems where traditional algorithms like decision trees are used.

TensorFlow is primarily used for deep learning tasks like neural networks and sequence modeling. 
It's best suited for complex models that require multiple layers and non-linear transformations.

Ease of Use for Beginners
Scikit-learn is easier for beginners to use because of its simple API, minimal setup, and intuitive functions for standard 
machine learning tasks. 

TensorFlow is more complex for beginners, especially when dealing with computational graphs,
 and training loops.

Community Support
Scikit-learn has a large and mature community, with extensive documentation and third-party libraries 
that support its use in various applications.

TensorFlow also has a very strong community, especially in the deep learning space. 
It offers tutorials and active forums, making it a popular choice for both researchers and developers.
